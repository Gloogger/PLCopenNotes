# Introduction

The operation mode of the _conveyor belt/revolving sushi restaurant_ generally goes like this: the sushi chef places the prepared sushi and other Japanese cuisine on plates of different colors and shapes (the color and shape are functional categories used to at the checkout), the chef will then lay these plates on a conveyor belt that passes through all restaurant tables. When those plates entered the sight of diners, they can simply take any plate that suit their appetite off the belt and, enjoy it. At checkout, the bill is settled by the number of plates with weighted factor determined by their color and shape.

* Enhance turnover rate (number of diners served per unit time);
* Friendly to shy and gauche population.

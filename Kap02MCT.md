A Coursera course called [Modern Robotics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics), made available by Northwestern University, covers the motion control theory in great detail. I found that course extremely helpful to me. There is an execellent course note produced by [MuchunSun](https://muchensun.github.io/ModernRoboticsCourseNotes/) which summarized the theories covered in _Modern Robotics_. And if you're looking for some discussion about textbook exercise, you also can check my note at [here](https://gloogger.github.io/Modern_Robotics_Notes/).

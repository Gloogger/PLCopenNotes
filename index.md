The notes here are taken for the motion control standard _PLCopen IEC61131-3_ during my internship @Gatherwin. These notes serve as a reminder and quick review material for future use.

# What is PLCopen?

Imagine you're a butler serving the Grandet family. Been Grandets, they hire no valet nor footman to share your load and expect you to do all the household chores. You are smart (but perhaps not that smart, judging from your choice of career), so you decide to automate some of your tasks using machines. You remember that once you were cooking dinner, and then the Grandets went back from the _Miser's Salon_. They rang the bell and waited at the door, as apparently they would never condescend to open it. You heard the bell, so you had to put down all the work on your hands, turned off the stove, and ran to answer the door. Afterwards, they haughtily blamed you for taking too long. 

> PLCopen was founded in 1992 just after the world wide programming standard IEC 61131-3 was published. The controls market at that time was a very heterogeneous market with different types of programming methods for many different PLCs. The IEC 61131-3 is a standard defining the programming languages for PLCs, embedded controls, and industrial PCs, harmonizing applications independent from specific dialects, but still based on known methods such as the textual programming languages Instruction List, and Structured Text, the graphical programming languages Function Block Diagram and Ladder Diagram (a.k.a. Ladder logic), and the structuring tool Sequential Function Chart.
